Build the sample using mvn install
Change to rest-service-war
Run mvn jetty:run
Open your favorite rest client and go to

http://localhost:8080/

- or -

In your IDE, run jetty, e.g. in Eclipse I recommend the run-jetty-run plugin. Depending on your launch configuration, the service URL will be

http://localhost:8080/rest-service-war

Be sure to pass Accept: application/json from your rest client in order to see the json output.
